Dr. Hartwell conducted much of his groundbreaking work at the University of Washington, where he is professor of genome sciences and adjunct professor of medicine. By combining mutants and time-lapse photomicroscopy, Hartwell has identified 32 genes that regulate the cell cycle, and he has used genetics to define many of the steps in the signal transduction pathway that feeds in Start, a control point in the cell cycle. The gene controlling Start, CDC28, was cloned in his lab and was the first CDK identified. He has discovered that limitation or overexpression of many essential cell-cycle components leads to errors in chromosome transmission."

  bio: "Lily Jan came to Caltech in 1968 for graduate study, after receiving her BS in physics from National Taiwan University.  Although she earned her MS in physics, she switched to biology, working with Max Delbrück and Jean-Paul Revel as her thesis advisors.During postdoctoral training with Seymour Benzer, she and her husband, Yuh-Nung Jan, began their long-term collaboration with studies that uncovered potassium channel abnormalities as the basis for the neurological phenotypes of mutant flies carrying the Shaker gene.  Similar neurological syndromes of human patients with episodic ataxia type I attest to the evolutionary conservation of potassium channel functions—a decade after Lily and Yuh-Nung Jan’s UC San Francisco laboratory cloned the fruit fly Shaker potassium channel and its mouse homolog, episodic ataxia type I was attributed to mutations of the human homolog of this Shaker gene.The Jan lab has followed up their studies of the Shaker family of voltage-gated potassium channels with the cloning of some members of another large family of potassium channels, inwardly rectifying potassium channels that control heart rate and neuronal excitability.  The lab has also pursued molecular and cell biological studies of how potassium channels work, and how they contribute to neuronal signaling and protect neurons and muscles under metabolic stress.Lily Jan is UCSF’s Jack and DeLoris Professor of Physiology and Biophysics."

Two years later, after receiving his MS in physics, he switched to biology.  Completing his PhD with Max Delbrück in 1975, he joined Seymour Benzer’s lab as a postdoctoral fellow, began working on Drosophila neurobiology, and started a long-term collaboration with his wife, Lily Jan—a collaboration that continues to this date.In Benzer’s lab, the couple began research on the Shaker gene that eventually led to the cloning of the first potassium channel.  From 1977 to 1979, they worked in Steve Kuffler’s lab at Harvard Medical School and found that peptides can function as neurotransmitters.  The Jans started their own lab at UC San Francisco in 1979, and have remained happily settled there ever since.At UCSF, besides continuing their work on potassium channels, they started working on neural development in order to understand how different neuronal cell fates and neuronal morphology are specified and how such diversity in neuronal morphology (especially dendritic morphology) contributes to the wiring of the nervous system.Yuh-Nung Jan is Jack and DeLoris Lange Professor of Molecular Physiology at UCSF."

In 1950, he was working as a gardener near the Caltech  campus. Having spent his high-school years in   the Manzanar internment camp and being, by his own admission, a terrible undergraduate student, he nevertheless decided to try making his dream of attending Caltech come true. He walked onto campus and ended up being interviewed by Nobel Laureate Max Delbrück, who recognized his potential and took him on as a graduate student.  After completing his PhD, Sato held postdoctoral positions at UC Berkeley and the University of Colorado Medical School, then joined the Brandeis University  faculty; he was a professor of biochemistry there from 1958 to 1969. He then moved to the biology department of UC San Diego, where he was a faculty member until 1983. From 1983 to 1992, he was a director of the W. Alton Jones  Cell Science Center in Lake Placid, New York. Sato has founded several biotechnology ventures, and in the early 1980s  codeveloped the cancer drug Erbitux. In recent years, he has devoted himself entirely to the Manzanar Project, which he started in the late 1980s to help alleviate famine in Ethiopia. To date, the project has planted some 600,000 mangrove trees—whose seeds provide feed for livestock—along the Eritrean coast."

This decision brought about a great improvement in Chinese agriculture and an increase in food production."

  bio: "Alvin Tollestrup, a physicist with the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in Batavia, Illinois, is internationally recognized for his work in experimental high-energy physics. He is well-known for the design and construction of Fermilab's Collider Detector Facility (CDF), which probes the structure of matter through the study of proton-antiproton annihilations and supports the research efforts of more than 30 institutions and hundreds of physicists. Before Joining Fermilab, Tollestrup was professor of physics at Caltech, where he helped to construct the electron synchrotron, a high-energy accelerator that played an instrumental role in characterizing the structure and properties of quarks, the fundamental building blocks of matter. Tollestrup also led a group that helped confirm the V-A theory of beta decay proposed by Murray Gell-Mann and the late Richard Feynman, both of Caltech. This research contributed significantly to the understanding of the weak nuclear interaction. Tollestrup received the National Medal of Technology in 1989 for creating the super-conducting magnets for the TEVATRON, the highest-energy accelerator in the United States."

  bio: "Charles Hard Townes graduated summa cum laude from Furman University with a B.S. in physics and a B.A. in modern languages. Dr. Townes received his M.A. in physics from Duke University in 1936 and his Ph.D. in 1939 from Caltech with a thesis on isotope separation and nuclear spins.
Dr. Townes worked extensively during World War II in designing radar-bombing systems and holds a number of patents in related technology. He then turned his attention to applying the microwave technique of wartime radar research to spectroscopy, which he foresaw as providing a powerful new tool for the study of the structure of atoms and molecules and as a potential new basis for controlling electromagnetic waves. 


In 1951, Dr. Townes and his associates at Columbia University began working on a device using ammonia gas as the active medium. In early 1954, this led to the first amplification and generation of electromagnetic waves by stimulated emission. He and his students coined the word “maser” for this device, an acronym for “microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.” In 1958, Dr. Townes and his brother-in-law, Dr. A. L. Schawlow, showed theoretically that masers could be made to operate in the optical and infrared region and proposed how this could be accomplished in particular systems. This work resulted in their joint paper on optical and infrared masers, or lasers (“light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation”). In astronomy and nonlinear optics he discovered the first complex molecules in space and detected and determined the mass of the large black hole in the center of our galaxy.
IIn 1961, Dr. Townes was appointed provost and professor of physics at MIT. In 1964, he shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Nicolay Gennadiyevich Basov and Aleksandr Mikhailovich Prokhorov of the Lebedev Institute for Physics, Moscow, “for fundamental work in quantum electronics which has led to the construction of oscillators and amplifiers based on the maser-laser principle.” He was appointed University Professor at the University of California in 1967.
Dr. Townes has served as a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the United States Air Force and as chairman of the Strategic Weapons Panel of the Department of Defense. He is presently chairman of the Science and Technology Advisory Committee for Manned Space Flight of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and is a member of the President’s Science Advisory Committee. Dr. Townes has served the American Physical Society in various capacities and is currently vice president. He is also a Trustee of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and the RAND Corporation. His scientific writings have been published in many technical journals.

In addition to the Nobel Prize for Physics, Dr. Townes’ honors and awards include the Research Corporation Annual Award; the IRE Morris N. Liebmann Memorial Prize; the Comstock Award, National Academy of Sciences; the Stuart Ballantine Medal, Franklin Institute; the Exceptional Service Award, US Air Force; the Rumford Premium, American Academy of Arts and Sciences; the AIEE David Sarnoff Award; the John J. Carty Medal, National Academy of Sciences; the Thomas Young Medal and Prize, the Institute of Physics and the Physical Society (England); the John Scott Award, City of Philadelphia; and the Joseph Priestley Award of Dickinson College. He received the IEEE Medal of Honor in 1967 “for his significant contributions in the field of quantum electronics which have led to the maser and the laser.” He received the Lomonosov Medal of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Rabindranath Tagore Award of India, and the Karl Schwarzschild Medal of German-speaking countries. He has also received numerous honorary degrees from universities in the US and abroad.
Dr. Townes continues to do research at the University of California, Berkeley."

Webster was inspired to go into this business after meeting a cardiologist who showed him how to modify existing catheters  by adding thermistors and electrodes. Some ten years later, the development of electrophysiology gave rise to a new medical practice: curing patients with heart arrhythmias by radio-frequency ablation using catheters. A young electrophysiologist of Webster’s acquaintance convinced him that his products could be further modified for use in this emerging field. Webster’s company became very successful, and too large for him to run alone. It merged with another producer of cardiovascular catheters, Cordis Corporation, in 1994, Webster came to his profession by a somewhat circuitous route. After graduating from Caltech, he worked for eight years for CF Braun and Co., a designer and builder of oil refineries and chemical plants. For the subsequent 10  years he sold custom electronic components manufactured by small start-up companies that had formed in response to the space race. Serendipitously, that work led to a hobby built around medical instrumentation and to an interest in cardiology, which in turn introduced him to cardiac catheters."
